// Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
  
//   * When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
//     * Train Name
    
//     * Destination 
    
//     * First Train Time -- in military time
    
//     * Frequency -- in minutes
  
//   * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
  
//   * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
  
//   * Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!
